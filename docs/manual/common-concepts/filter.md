# Filter

Almost all data lists within the admin control panel include a **Filter** gadget.

Typing a text snippet into the filter box will instantly filter the list of items to show only those whose titles or descriptions contain the text in your filter.

You may additionally select the *Prefix* option, which will limit the results to those items whose titles or descriptions *start* with the text in the filter.

Finally, there is a cancel control, which will clear the filter text and reset the *prefix* option, returning your list to its unfiltered state.
