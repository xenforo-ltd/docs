# Activity summary

## What is the activity summary email?

The activity summary is a useful tool for reaching out to registered members who may not have been keeping up-to-date with your community.

Tools are provided to generate a rich list of content, designed to encourage your inactive members to return to the forum.

### Constructing the email

The activity summary can be built with a series of content sections, each of which may select content in a variety of ways.

To build your email summary:

1. Log in to the Admin Control Panel
1. Go to **Communication > Activity summary**.
1. Either click on an existing section to edit it, or click on **Add activity summary section** to create a new one.
1. Choose an activity summary section template from the list that will be shown, then click **Add section**.
1. On the next page, use the form to build search parameters to find content that will be included in this section of the activity summary email.

For example, you may want to select the first five threads from specific forums, sorted by their date in descending order, which would return the most recently posted threads.

:::note
The activity summary email is generated live at the time that it is sent, so there is no need to rebuild the email manually each time you expect it to be sent.

### Configuring user parameters

When enabled, your summary email will be sent to the users who match the parameters listed in the **Activity summary email** settings.

1. Log in to the Admin Control Panel
1. Go to **Setup > Options > Email options**.
1. Scroll down to the **Activity summary email** group of settings and ensure that the option is **enabled**.
1. Configure the number of days of inactivity after which users will start to receive the email, how frequently they will continue to receive the email while they remain inactive, and after how many days of inactivity the user should be abandoned.
