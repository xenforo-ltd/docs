# RSS feed importer

The RSS feed importer allows you to automatically create threads by importing the content of RSS feeds. This can help generate new content for discussion on your site.

The RSS feed importer can be setup via **Forums > RSS feed importer**.

:::warning
Before importing content from any RSS feeds, please ensure that you have permission to publish the content. You may wish to only use feeds which include a small snippet of the content they relate to.
:::

When creating a feed, you must choose the forum into which the thread will be posted, and the user to be attributed as the author of the thread to be created. If you select the guest option, the name associated with the thread will be the author value provided by the feed.

The "message template" option controls hows the feed content will be formatted within the thread. Any placeholder tokens used in this option will be replaced with values from the feed before posting.
