# Completing the import

Once the import process has run its course, either through the browser or the command line, you will either be taken to the **Complete import** page, or directed to refresh your browser so that the **Complete import** page is shown.

Here, you will see a summary of all the steps that were run, along with the time taken to run each step, and how many items were imported by each step.

Only one thing remains before your imported data is ready to be used, which is a rebuild of all the caches that XenForo uses. These will be built when you hit the **Complete import** button. This process may take a few moments, or several minutes to complete, depending on the volume of data that was imported, and how much data was already in your XenForo database.
