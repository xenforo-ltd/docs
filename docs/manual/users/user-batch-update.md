# Batch update users

It is possible to apply changes to multiple users using the **batch update users** tool.

To apply a batch update to a selection of users:

1. Log in to the **Admin control panel**
1. Go to **Users > Batch update users**
1. Use the [user criteria](../common-concepts/criteria.md#user-criteria) searcher to identify the users to whom you want to apply the update.

You may then apply a variety of changes, including setting primary and secondary [user groups](../access-privileges/groups-permissions.md), removing user group memberships, setting user state and [security lock](user-security.md) status and various others.
