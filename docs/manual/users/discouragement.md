# Discouragement

At times, banning a person may not be entirely effective. With the design of browsers, it's easy for a problematic user to register a new account.

### The principle

*Discouraging* aims to make using the site slow and painful for a problematic user, such that they eventually give up and leave. According to the system configuration, each time a user subject to discouragement attempts to load a page, there is a chance that it will fail to load, a change that it will result in a blank page, a change that it will take a very long time to complete etc.

Discouraged users are not made aware that they are subject to this *special* treatment.

You may fine-tune the diabolical behavior of the discouragement system using the options at **Setup > Options > User discouragement and discipline**.

### Discouraging specific users

A user can be discouraged by editing the user in the control panel and enabling the *Discouraged* option. The behavior of the discouragement system can be controlled by [options](../configuration/options.md) in the *User discouragement and discipline* group.

### Discouraging by IP address

Alternatively, specific IP ranges can be discouraged. This helps ensure that the behavior is maintained even when the targeted user is not logged in.
