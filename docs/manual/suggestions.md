# Suggestions

Suggestions are one of XenForo's [forum and thread types](forum-thread-types.md).

### Suggestion threads

Suggestion threads are useful when you want to solicit feedback from your community in a structured fashion.

The first post of a suggestion thread is considered to be the suggestion, and controls are available to allow users with appropriate permissions to [vote the suggestion up or down](content-voting.md#content-voting) depending upon how they feel about it.

The [vote score](content-voting.md#vote-score) for a suggestion will determine its position within its parent forum, with suggestions having a higher vote score appearing further up the list than those with a lower vote score.

:::note
Suggestion threads may **only** be posted within dedicated [suggestion forums](suggestions.md#suggestion-forums), as the behaviour of the suggestion forum in ordering the contained suggestions is crucial to the functionality of the suggestion thread type.

### Suggestion forums

As described above, suggestion forums are the only forum type that may contain [suggestions threads](suggestions.md#suggestion-threads). The [vote score](content-voting.md#vote-score) for each suggestion is displayed prominently in the thread listing.

Suggestion threads are shown ordered with those having a higher vote score before those with a lower score.

Filter controls are available to allow the list of threads to quickly be filtered down to **popular** or **new** solutions, along with options to show only the visitor's own suggestions or vote.
