# Install or upgrade?

If you are not yet running XenForo and want to deploy the self-hosted software to your server, you need to [install](install.md) it.

Alternatively, if you are already running XenForo but you want to update the software to a newer version, you need to [upgrade](upgrade.md).

:::note
Please ensure that your server meets [XenForo's requirements](https://xenforo.com/purchase/requirements-zip).

2. Upload the contents of the `upload` directory within the extracted files to your server.
3. Point your browser to the install/upgrade system and follow the on-screen instructions.
