# Closing the forums

One of the most important options controls whether or not the forums are open to visitors.

The **Board is active** option in the *Board active* option group toggles this.

When the board is *not* active, all visitors apart from those administrators with admin control panel access will be shown the message you enter in the **Inactive board message** box.

Visitors *will not be able to view or post any content* while the board is not active, so don't forget to reactivate the board once you've finished doing whatever necessitated their closure!

It's usually a good idea to close the forums for essential maintenance operations, like running XenForo upgrades, importing data and installing large or complex add-ons.
