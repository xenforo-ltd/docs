# Threads
Threads will be where your primary forum content is posted. Each thread will be created within a particular forum, though they can be moved by moderators if needed.

At its simplest, a thread is created by a user with a title and the text that will make up the first post. All replies will consist of additional text (without a title) attributed to a user, however there are various ways to add additional structure and functionality to threads, as described in [Forum and thread types](forum-thread-types.md).

There are ways to add functionality and customization to threads, such as with [custom thread fields](thread-fields.md), [thread prefixes](thread-prefixes.md) and [thread prompts](thread-prompts.md).
