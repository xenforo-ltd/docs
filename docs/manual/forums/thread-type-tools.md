# Thread type tools

Additional attention must be paid to threads when operations are performed upon them that would move them from one forum to another.

For example, moving a [discussion thread](discussions.md#discussion-threads) into a [suggestion forum](suggestions.md#suggestion-forums) (which can contain only [suggestion threads](suggestions.md#suggestion-threads)) will automatically convert the thread type from [discussion](discussions.md#discussion-threads) to [suggestion](suggestions.md#suggestion-threads), and moving a [suggestion thread](suggestions.md#suggestion-threads) into a [discussion forum](discussions.md#discussion-forums) will convert it to a plain [discussion](discussions.md#discussion-threads), which will cause all votes cast for that suggestion to be lost.

:::warning
Moving a [discussion](discussions.md#discussion-threads), [article](articles.md#article-threads) or [question](questions.md#question-threads) thread out of a dedicated [discussion](discussions.md#discussion-forums), [article](articles.md#article-forums) or [question](questions.md#question-forums) forum into a [mixed-type forum](discussions.md#mixed-type-forums) will allow the thread type to remain, though of course it will lose the forum-specific behaviours it had when it belonged to a type-specific forum.
:::

Suggestion threads may **only** be moved into [suggestion forums](suggestions.md#suggestion-forums) if the special properties of suggestion threads are to be retained.

:::note
These notes for *moving* threads also apply to other operations that may *effectively* move threads from one forum to another, such as **merging**, **copying** and **spam cleaning**.
