# Forum and thread types
The basic structure of a forum is a container for threads, those being a collection of posts, but from [version 2.2](https://xenforo.com/community/threads/forum-and-thread-types.181789/) onwards, XenForo allows that model to be extended to support a variety of different behaviours.

Forum and thread types include basic [discussions](discussions.md), which can contain [polls](discussions.md#poll-threads), [articles](articles.md) where the first post in a forum is made especially prominent, [questions](questions.md) which can have any number of answers and an accepted [solution](questions.md#solutions), and [suggestions](suggestions.md) where users can influence the popularity of an idea with votes.

## Caution when moving threads

Care must be taken when threads are moved between forums, to ensure that any special behaviours can be retained at their destination.
