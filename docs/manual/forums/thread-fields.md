# Custom thread fields

Custom thread fields allow you to define additional structured fields for users to fill in when creating a thread. Similar to custom user fields, these fields can various types of form inputs, including textboxes, radio buttons and checkboxes.

Custom thread field can be setup in the control panel under **Forums > Custom thread fields**.

Custom thread fields relate to the thread itself and therefore are only applicable to the initial thread content. Replies will not be prompted to enter these fields.

Each custom thread field value will be displayed in one of several locations:

1. **Before message**: in the body of the first post of the thread, directly above the message content.
2. **After message**: in the body of the first post of the thread, directly below the message content.
3. **Thread status block**: above the first post on the page, in a separate small block. Note that this will be displayed on all pages of the thread.

Like with prefixes, you can use the **Applicable forums** and **Editable by user groups** options to control where the field is displayed and who can enter a value for the field.
