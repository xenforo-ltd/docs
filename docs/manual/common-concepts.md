# Common concepts in the XenForo Admin Control Panel

Some concepts and principles are used throughout the XenForo system, so having an understanding of some of these will save you some head-scratching later.

### Naming

For historical reasons, some concepts and content types may be referred to with different names at different times and in some cases separate items may share a name.

The most important of these are described here.

#### The Forum

When referring to the area of your site created by the XenForo software, we may variously refer to it using the following terms:

* Your **forum**
* Your **board** 
* Your **installation**
* Your **site**

While it is common to refer to a XenForo discussion website as a *forum*, this term is also used to describe [individual sections of your discussion site](common-concepts.md#forums) as described below. 

The term *board* hails from the origins of forums in pre-Internet [bulletin board systems (BBS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system).

Normally we would avoid using the term *site*, as this would refer to the entirety of your website rather than just the parts created by XenForo.

#### Forums

Confusingly, your *forum* may be subdivided using the [node tree](nodes-forums.md) into several *forums*, each of which is a container for [threads](common-concepts.md#threads). Each of these *forums* will have a title, describing the subject matter of the content within.

#### Threads

Threads are individual discussions within a [forum](common-concepts.md#forums). In other software systems and services they are also known as *discussions* or *topics*, but *threads* is the term used within XenForo.

#### Posts

Individual messages within [threads](common-concepts.md#threads) are known as posts. As with [threads](common-concepts.md#threads), these items are also known as *messages* or *replies*, but within XenForo we call them *posts*.
