# Payment profiles

XenForo provides the ability to handle payments from your users using a variety of payment processors.

Payments can currently be handled through:

* Stripe
* PayPal
* BrainTree
* 2Checkout

Several of these allow credit and debit card payments to be accepted.

To set up a payment processor, you need to configure a *Payment profile* via **Options > Service providers > Payment profiles > Add payment profile**.

Select the processor you want to use from the list then enter all the required configuration data according to the field descriptions on the form.

Once a payment profile is successfully defined, you will be able to add it to the list of payment options your users may choose when purchasing a [User upgrade](user-upgrades.md), to buy or subscribe to access to restricted features or content you have set up.
